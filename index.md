## SCiMMA Institute Membership
The Scalable Cyberinfrastructure for Multi-Messenger Astronomy (SCiMMA) Institute is in its conceptualization phase. There are currently 10 participating universities and/or observatories who are building systems and software. If you are participating in SCiMMA related activities at one of these participating organizations, please use the appropriate link below to apply for enrollment in the SCiMMA Institute Identity and Access Management System.

You will be required to login before proceeding. Please look for your University or Observatory in the list where you select an "Identity Provider". If you cannot find your institution in the list, you may use [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) login if you have one (if you are a working research, you should probably create one if you don't have one already). As a last resort, you may use Google.

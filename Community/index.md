## SCiMMA Community Enrollment
Welcome to the SCiMMA Community Virtual Workshop session on Identity and Access Management. In order to follow along with the workshop, you will need to enroll into the SCiMMA Community. For the purposes of the workshop, we are asking you to enroll into only one of the two teams we have created to show how access controls work. Please click on either the Blue Team or the Red Team enrollment button below.
